# GOATShell
The GOATShell is a Python implementation of a shell that has many of the features of the standard Linux shell, including the ability to start processes on the operating system and supports GLOB notation, shell built-ins, quoting and escape chars, input and output redirection, piping input between commands, subcommands, and compliance with a standard POSIX file system, but also includes our own tasks for the shell to perform such as sPonGEbObtEXt.
